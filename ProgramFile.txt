13.7The Java programming language was developed by Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s. Java was originally designed for embedded network applications running on multiple platforms.
Java is extremely portable.
 Besides portability, another of Java's key advantages is its set of security features which protect a PC running a Java program not only from problems caused by erroneous code but also from malicious programs (such as viruses).
 An applet is typically a small Java program that is embedded within an HTML
Java can be considered both a compiled and an interpreted language because its source code is first compiled into a binary byte-code.
 The use of compiled byte-code allows the interpreter (the virtual machine) to be small and efficient (and nearly as fast as the CPU running native, compiled code).
 Most Web browsers (such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Communicator) contain a JVM to run Java
Compared to C++ (another object-oriented language), Java code runs a little slower (because of the JVM) but it is more portable and has much better security features.
 Java's syntax is similar to C++ but the languages are quite different.
 In addition, Java is a dynamic language where you can safely modify a program while it is running, whereas C++ does not allow it.
 Also, all basic Java data types are predefined and not platform-dependent, whereas some data types can change with the platform used in C or C++ (such as the int
Java programs are more highly structured than C++ equivalents.
 Global data and methods cannot reside outside of a class in Java, whereas C++ allows this.
Another key feature of Java is that it is an open standard with publicly available source code.
 You can freely download all the tools you need to develop and run Java applets and applications from Sun's Java Web site (http://java.
In this example, the class AverageProgram (which is the program) contains only one method (function), main().
 Even the while() statement works as it would in C/C++.

As with the other programming languages we have surveyed, this was just a brief view of Java.
